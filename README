This directory contains the following 19 files:

1. This README file.

2. FPIC source files:
        fpic.sml
        types.sml
        context.sml
        environment.sml
        primitives.sml
        latexboxes.sml
        pstricks.sml
        newprimitives.sml
        regexp.sml
        packages.sml
        helpers.sml
        points.sml
        text.sml
   Load FPIC by starting SML and entering "use fpic.sml".

3. Style file fpic.sty.  This file must be included, along with the
   pstricks style files, in any Latex file that uses FPIC.

4. Documentation in the form of two HTML documents:
        index.html
        fpicdefs.html

5. The postscript file paper.ps.  This is a *preliminary* version of
  the paper "A Special-purpose Language for Picture-Drawing, by myself
  and David Hyatt.  The final version will be given at the DSL '97
  conference in Santa Barbara in October.

6. The file paperpics.sml contains the pictures used in the preliminary
   version of the paper.  The paper was written before the Latex
   integration was done, so this file is a separate list of all the
   pictures.  Each is drawn using the "draw" command, which creates a
   file of pstricks commands which are in turn input into Latex
   documents using \input.  This method is now obsolete.  The final
   version of the paper will include the pictures using the mechanism
   that is outlined in index.html.
