FPIC Operations
</H2>

<P>
These are the user-level functions defined in FPIC.
The most important type is Picture.
Users will also use operations on real numbers and on Points.

<P>
Lengths are given in centimeters.

<P>
<H3>Basic pictures</H3>

<P>
In addition to drawing the pictures, these operations
also create environments naming the points of that picture
corresponding to compass directions.
These points are called n, s, e, w, ne, se, nw, and sw, as
well as center.
Where indicated, some additional points may be automatically
named.
Users can add additional named points as well as named subpictures
using the operations in the
<A HREF="#environment">environments section</A>.

<P>
<UL>
<LI> <code>empty</code>: Picture.
<LI> <code>box</code>: Real * Real -> Picture.  Arguments are width and height.
<LI> <code>oval</code>: Real * Real -> Picture.  Same as box arguments.

<LI> <code>openCurve</code>: Point list -> Picture.  Interpolates an open curve.
<LI> <code>closedCurve</code>: Point list -> Picture.  Interpolates a closed curve.
<LI> <code>wedge</code>: real * real * real -> Picture.
   wedge rad theta1 theta2 draws a wedge of a circle of radius rad
   from angle theta1 to theta2.
   Angles are given in degrees.
   The wedge is drawn counterclockwise, so that wedge 1.0 10.0 -10.0
   will draw almost an entire circle.
<LI> <code>arc</code>: real * real * real -> Picture.  Same arguments as wedge.
<LI> <code>arccw</code>: real * real * real -> Picture.  Same arguments as arc, but
  with the arc drawn clockwise from the first angle to the second.
<LI> <code>square</code>: real -> Picture.
<LI> <code>triangle</code>: Point -> Point -> Point -> Point.

<LI> <code>vspace</code>: Real -> Picture.  Zero-width vertical space.
<LI> <code>dbox, doval, dcircle, dtriangle</code>: Picture.
  These are "default" shapes, useful when the exact shape doesn't
  really matter.
  For boxes and ovals, uses the golden ratio.
  The triangle is an equilateral triangle with base 1.
</UL>

<H3>Lines</H3>

<P>
These are mainly functions from pairs of points to pictures.
In addition to the compass points (which don't really make
that much sense for lines), the have named points
start, end, and midpoint.

<P>
<UL>
<LI> <code>line</code>: Point * Point -> Picture.  Draws a line between the
    two points.
<LI> <code>arrow</code>: Point -> Point -> Picture.
<LI> <code>doublearrow</code>: Point -> Point -> Picture.
<LI> <code>harrow</code>: real -> real -> Picture.  harrow ht leng draws an
   arrow at height ht and length leng from left to right.
<LI> <code>curvedhline, curvedvline</code>: Point -> Point -> Picture.
   Draw a curved line, with the first leg of the curve either
   horizontal or vertical.
</UL>


<H3>Transformations</H3>

<P>
Transformations are translation, rotation, scaling, changes of color,
and other stuff.
Many of these transformations come directly from pstricks.

<P>
There is a fine line between translation operations, in which
a picture is moved, and
sequencing operations, in which two pictures are drawn together,
with one of them usually being moved.
We have placed operations that move a single picture here, and
operations that combine two pictures, even when they involve a
translation of one of the pictures, in the section on
<A HREF="#sequencing">sequencing operations</A>.

<P>
<UL>

  a picture.
<LI> <code>transformedWith</code>: Picture * Matrix -> Picture (infix).

</UL>

<A NAME="sequencing">
<H3>Picture-combining (sequencing) operations</H3>

</UL>

<A NAME="environments">
<H3> Environment-oriented operations </H3>

<P>
These operations relate to naming and numbering of pictures.
All pictures come with some of their points named, as
described above.
Users may add additional named points using the operations
listed here.
Note that named points are transformed long with the picture
itself, so that point "s" may not be south at all, if the picture
has been rotated.
To get "true" south, or any other point, use
operations boundingBox and related operations like north and
center, which are also included in this section.

<P>
An irritating subtlety here has to do with numbering of subpictures.
Since all operations are binary, it would seem that every compound
picture would have only two subpictures, which is counterintuitive,
so the combining operations listed above will generally "flatten"
the environment structure.
On the other hand, some structure is desirable.
So, the group operation prevents the flattening of that
picture within a larger picture.
For example, <code>p1 seq p2 seq p3</code> has three subpictures
(numbered 1, 2, and 3), while
<code>p1 seq (group (p2 seq p3))</code> has two subpictures,
the second of which has two subpictures.
When named pictures are added using addNamedPic or addNamedPics,
they are automatically grouped.

<P>
<UL>
<LI> <code>group</code>: Picture -> Picture.  Groups all the subpictures in
  a compound picture into a single picture.
  This affects the numbering of pictures in the nthPic function.
<LI> <code>pt</code>: Picture * string -> Point (infix).  pt p s is the point
  named s in picture p.
<LI> <code>pic</code>: Picture * string -> Picture (infix).  pic p s is the picture
  named s in picture p.
<LI> <code>nthpic</code>: Picture * int -> Picture (infix).  pic p n is the nth
  picture in p.
<LI> <code>namePt</code>: Picture -> string -> Point -> Picture.  pic p s pt is
  the picture p with the point pt having name s.
<LI> <code>namePts</code>: Picture -> (string * Point) list -> Picture.
<LI> <code>namePic</code>: Picture -> string -> Picture.
  Name a picture, so that it will have this name when placed inside
  a compound picture.
  This will also have the effect of grouping this picture (the grouping
  will be done at the time the picture is added to the larger picture).
<LI> <code>addNamedPic</code>: Picture -> string -> Picture -> Picture.
  addNamedPic p1 str p2 is the picture p1 with picture p2 named str.
<LI> <code>addNamedPics</code>: Picture -> (string * Picture) list -> Picture.
<LI> <code>pics</code>:  Picture -> (string * Picture) list.
  All of the subpictures that have names.
<LI> <code>pts</code>: Picture -> (string * Point) list.
  All of the points in the picture that have names, along with those names.
<LI> <code>boundingBox</code>: Picture -> Point * Point * Point * Point.
  The points in a bounding box are given in order northwest, northeast,
  southwest, and southeast.
<LI> <code>width</code>: Picture -> real.
<LI> <code>height</code>: Picture -> real.
<LI> <code>center, north, south, east, west, northeast, northwest, southeast,
  southwest</code>: Picture -> Point.
<LI> <code>trueOrigin</code>: Picture -> Point.
</UL>

<H3> Colors </H3>

<P>
Colors are just triples of real numbers
(RGB values) between 0 and 1.
The predefined colors are</code>:

<UL>
<LI> <code>red = (1.0,0.0,0.0)
<LI> <code>green = (0.0,1.0,0.0)
<LI> <code>blue = (0.0,0.0,1.0)
<LI> <code>white = (1.0,1.0,1.0)
<LI> <code>black = (0.0,0.0,0.0)
<LI> <code>magenta = (1.0,0.0,1.0)
<LI> <code>cyan = (0.0,1.0,1.0)
<LI> <code>lightGray = (0.7,0.7,0.7)
<LI> <code>darkGray = (0.4,0.4,0.4)
<LI> <code>yellow = (1.0,1.0,0.0)
</UL>


<H3> Point operations </H3>

<P>
These operations create points, which are pairs of real's, or
otherwise manipulate them.

<P>
<UL>
<LI> <code>++</code>: Point * Point -> Point (infix).
<LI> <code>--</code>: Point * Point -> Point (infix).
<LI> <code>**</code>: Point * Point -> Point (infix).
<LI> <code>//</code>: Point * Point -> Point (infix).
<LI> <code>distance</code>: Point -> Point -> real.
<LI> <code>midpoint</code>: Point -> Point -> Point.
